\section{Introduction}

A personal information management system, henceforth \gls{pims}, is a system
directed towards the storage and organization of information exclusively
relevant for the user of the system.

This paper deals with the question how and whether conventional \gls{pims}
can be further improved to appeal more strongly to technically inclined
people.

Conventional \gls{pims} such as digital to-do lists and notebooks allow the
recording and organization of information in a linear fashion meaning that
information can only be stored sequentially on pages or notes. Changing the
structure and order of the information is always coupled to the change of the
information itself since the pages the information is stored on have to be
changed.

The human mind, however, does not process information in a sequential manner
as those traditional \gls{pims} do. [reference] The mind processes information
in relation to other information. This allows for a very efficient processing
of information.

When information was primarily stored on analogue media, such as stone and
paper, a sequential approach to information storage was necessary. Since the
majority of the western population is equipped with a smartphone or a personal
computer [reference], a sequential approach may no longer be the optimal
solution to a \gls{pims}.
