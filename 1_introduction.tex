\section{Introduction}

A personal information management system, henceforth \gls{pims}, is a system
directed towards the storage and organization of information exclusively
relevant for the user of the system only.

This paper deals with the question how and whether conventional \gls{pims}
can be further improved to appeal more strongly to technically inclined
people.

Conventional \gls{pims} such as digital to-do lists and notebooks allow the
recording and organization of information in a linear fashion meaning that
information can only be stored sequentially on pages or notes. Changing the
structure and order of the information is always coupled to the change of the
information itself since the pages the information is stored on have to be
changed.

mind does not work in linear fashion but in relationships...
