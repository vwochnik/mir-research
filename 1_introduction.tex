\section{Introduction}

Kind of research: Explanatory empirical research

Research Topic: Personal Information Management Systems

Research Question: How can conventional personal information management systems be improved?

Story: Conventional systems are not optimal for technically inclined people because they only allow linear information storage.
There are no relationships between bits of information. Furthermore, information cannot be reorganized easily without changing the information itself.

A personal information management system, henceforth \gls{pims}, is a system
directed towards the storage and organization of information exclusively
relevant for the user of the system only.
