\section*{Abstract}

\noindent Conventional personal information management systems such as diaries, to-do lists and analog notebooks are rather inconvenient for the management of information since information that is once written down cannot easily be combined with other information or moved to a different place. This newly proposed system treats data which can be text, speech or images as atoms which can then be connected with each other. This way, it becomes very easy to manage information once in the system.

This is where smartwatches come into play: A smartwatch is a terrible device for actually managing information but is excellent for the input of such. Information that has been entered in the system can then be managend using traditional devices such as smartphones or personal computers.
