\section*{Abstract}

\noindent This paper proposes a new user interaction concept for personal
information management systems allowing for more flexibility and a more
efficient workflow.

The proposed solution is centered around chunks of unstructured data which can
be organized by means of various interactive visualization models allowing the
user to change connections and attributes of the data by changing the
visualization itself. Data can be organized using not only one but multiple
visualization models which can interactively be changed and swapped.

Traditional personal information management systems do not offer the flexibility
and interactivity of the proposed solution but a mere fraction thereof. Most
restrict the user to one model of visualization.

To demonstrate this, traditional personal information management systems are
analyzed and areas for improvement of their user interaction concept are
determined. Thereafter, criteria for an improved solution are established.

Following the proposed solution, a short conclusion shows the compliance with
the priorly established criteria and thereby determines whether the proposed
solution actually is an improvement over traditional systems.
